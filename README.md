1. Summary of Requirements and Goals

The core objective of the "WeightMate" mobile application was to offer users a straightforward and efficient way to track their daily weight. Recognizing that many individuals want to monitor their weight for health or fitness reasons but often face difficulties with cumbersome apps, WeightMate was designed to fill this gap. It directly addresses the user's need for an easy-to-use weight log system, integrating features such as adding, updating, deleting, and viewing daily weights.

2. User-centered UI Design

The application consists of essential screens like the login page, the main weight tracking dashboard, and the weight log. Each screen was meticulously crafted with the end-user in mind. The UI provides clear call-to-action buttons, intuitive navigation, and a simple yet effective grid system for viewing weight logs. Our design's success lies in its simplicity and intuitiveness, ensuring that users, regardless of their tech-savviness, can benefit from the app without a steep learning curve.

3. Approach to App Coding

When developing WeightMate, I started by setting up a structured plan, identifying key features, and then breaking down those features into manageable tasks. Leveraging Android Studio and SQLite for the backend, I employed an iterative development process, regularly testing each functionality as it was added. Adopting a modular approach ensured that components could be individually developed and integrated, a strategy I believe will serve me well in future projects.

4. Testing and its Significance

Testing was a continuous and crucial aspect of the development process. By using the Android Emulator, I was able to simulate the user experience, ensuring that features worked as intended. This process not only revealed bugs or inconsistencies in the system but also provided insights into potential areas of improvement. Rigorous testing is indispensable as it guarantees the app's stability and usability.

5. Overcoming Challenges

During the app's development, one challenge encountered was integrating SMS notifications, especially considering the varying permissions across different Android versions. Innovation came in the form of a dynamic permission-checking system that ensured a smooth user experience irrespective of their choice to grant permissions.

6. Demonstrated Expertise

A component where I believe I particularly showcased my proficiency was in the database integration for weight tracking. Ensuring the persistent storage of user data, efficient querying, and seamless data display on the UI demanded a thorough understanding of both frontend and backend interactions, and I'm proud of the efficient system I crafted.
